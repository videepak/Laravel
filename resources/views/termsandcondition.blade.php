Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Trash Scan cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Trash Scan customer support team.
A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Trash Scan with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Trash Scan to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Trash Scan will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
